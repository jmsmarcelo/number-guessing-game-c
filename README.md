# Number Guessing Game CLI

A cross-platform number guessing game written in pure **C**, as part of the **[Roadmap.sh Challenge](https://roadmap.sh/projects/number-guessing-game)**.
Includes difficulty level, input validation, modular structure, and a final hint mechanic.

## üì¶ Features

- Difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard
- Cross-platform random number generation
- Safe user input handling (no crashes or infinite loops)
- Smart Hints:
  - Tells if the target number is higher or lower than the last guess
  - On your last chance, tells if the number is **even or odd**
